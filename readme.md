##### PDO

- PHP data objects (PHP Extension).
- Lean and consistent way to access the database.

  (can be used in place of `mysqli`.

  unlike `mysqli` which only works with mysql db , `PDO` works with bunch of other db )

- works with multiple database.
- Data access layer

  (No matter what db you are using you will use same functions to run query and fetch data)

- Object oriented (works with >= php 5 )
